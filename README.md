Hi, I'm Matt! I'm a Senior Data Analyst at https://rs21.io/, a software and data science company based out of New Mexico.

## Public Projects
_While for most of my time at RS21, I've worked on projects supporting data analysis and management in the federal government, there are a few projects that I've been involved in at the state level in New Mexico that resulted in some publically available applications:_
### Work with the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission
Mainstream New Mexico Water Planning Application (https://mainstreamnm.org/new-mexicos-water-data-now-an-interactive-journey/)
- Led data cleaning, analysis, and design efforts.
- Built summary data layers to show water planners how the climate, environment, demographics, water use, etc. change between tentative water planning regions.

### Work with the New Mexico Office of Broadband Access and Expansion
